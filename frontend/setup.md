# Setup Instructions for Calculator App

## Issue Resolution: pnpm ENOENT Error

The original project was configured for `pnpm`, but the system doesn't have `pnpm` installed. Here's how to resolve this:

### Option 1: Use npm instead (Recommended)

Since npm is typically available by default, use these commands:

```bash
# Navigate to the project directory
cd frontend

# Install dependencies with npm
npm install

# Start development
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Run tests
npm run test:ci
```

### Option 2: Install pnpm globally

If you want to use pnpm specifically:

```bash
# Install pnpm globally
npm install -g pnpm

# Then use pnpm commands
pnpm install
pnpm build
pnpm test:ci
```

### Option 3: Use provided scripts

Use the install.sh script provided:

```bash
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh install
./install.sh build
```
